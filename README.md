# JAAM

A music application that allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on separate devices. Users can select instruments and drums from an instrument library and create a song together. Create your own song, or join others in a public JAAM session.

## Getting started

If you have an account, simply login. If you don't have an account, login with Google or signup.
Once you are logged in, you can join a public JAAM session or create your own session by clicking 'new project'.

## Making music
### Sequencer

Instruments are represented by a grid. Each row represents a musical pitch; each column represents a musical beat. Clicking cells on the grid highlights them. When the playhead passes through each column, only the highlighted cells will play.

### edit project

Add instruments by clicking the plus icon in the upper left corner. Select the percussion slider to add drums. Once an instrument is created, change the type and key by clicking the gear icon on the instrument panel. You can set the tempo by adjusting the tempo slider and clicking 'set tempo'. Invite users by email and edit project title by clicking the settings icon in the upper right corner of project view.
